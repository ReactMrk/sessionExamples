# **Client management testing**
Many developers will be working on this app at the same time and a lot of functionalities will be added. We should create unit test to make sure that no functionality is accidentally broken.


Use proper node version: **nvm use**

Install dependencies: **npm install**

Run app: **npm run dev**
